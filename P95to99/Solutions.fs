/// which are themselves translations of Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems
/// (http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)
/// and Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems

///
/// If you would like to contribute a solution or fix any bugs, send 
/// an email to paks at kitiara dot org with the subject "99 F# problems". 
/// I'll try to update the problem as soon as possible.
///
/// The problems have different levels of difficulty. Those marked with a single asterisk (*) 
/// are easy. If you have successfully solved the preceeding problems you should be able to 
/// solve them within a few (say 15) minutes. Problems marked with two asterisks (**) are of 
/// intermediate difficulty. If you are a skilled F# programmer it shouldn't take you more than 
/// 30-90 minutes to solve them. Problems marked with three asterisks (***) are more difficult. 
/// You may need more time (i.e. a few hours or more) to find a good solution
///
/// Though the problems number from 1 to 99, there are some gaps and some additions marked with 
/// letters. There are actually only 88 problems.

// [snippet: (**) Problem 95 : English number words]
/// On financial documents, like cheques, numbers must sometimes be written in full words. 
/// Example: 175 must be written as one-seven-five. Write a predicate full-words/1 to print 
/// (non-negative) integer numbers in full words.
///  
/// Example in F#: 
/// 
/// > fullWords 175;;
/// val it : string = "one-seven-five"

// [snippet: (**) Problem 96 : Syntax checker]
/// In a certain programming language (Ada) identifiers are defined by the syntax diagram below.
///  
///   ---->|letter|---+-------------------------------------+------>
///                   |                                     |
///                   +--------------+------>|letter|---+---+

///                   +--->| - |---+   +---->|digit |---+
///                   |                                 |
///                   +---------------------------------+
///
/// Transform the syntax diagram into a system of syntax diagrams which do not contain loops;
/// i.e. which are purely recursive. Using these modified diagrams, write a predicate 
/// identifier/1 that can check whether or not a given string is a legal identifier.
///  
/// Example in Prolog: 
/// % identifier(Str) :- Str is a legal identifier 
///  
/// Example in F#: 
/// 
/// > identifier "this-is-a-long-identifier";;
/// val it : bool = true
/// > identifier "this-ends-in-";;
/// val it : bool = false
/// > identifier "two--hyphens";;
/// val it : bool = false

// [snippet: (***) Problem 98 : Nonograms]
/// Around 1994, a certain kind of puzzle was very popular in England. The "Sunday Telegraph" 
/// newspaper wrote: "Nonograms are puzzles from Japan and are currently published each week 
/// only in The Sunday Telegraph. Simply use your logic and skill to complete the grid and 
/// reveal a picture or diagram." As a Prolog programmer, you are in a better situation: you 
/// can have your computer do the work! Just write a little program ;-).
///
/// The puzzle goes like this: Essentially, each row and column of a rectangular bitmap is 
/// annotated with the respective lengths of its distinct strings of occupied cells. The 
/// person who solves the puzzle must complete the bitmap given only these lengths.
///
///             Problem statement:          Solution:

// [snippet: (***) Problem 99 : Crossword puzzle]
/// Given an empty (or almost empty) framework of a crossword puzzle and a set of words. The 
/// problem is to place the words into the framework.
///             
///                P R O L O G     E 
///                E   N     N     M
///                R   L i N U X   A
///                L   i   F   M A C    
///                    N   S Q L   S
///                    E
///                  W E B
///
/// The particular crossword puzzle is specified in a text file which first lists the words
/// (one word per line) in an arbitrary order. Then, after an empty line, the crossword 
/// framework is defined. In this framework specification, an empty character location is 
/// represented by a dot (.). In order to make the solution easier, character locations can 
/// also contain predefined character values. The puzzle above is defined in the file 
/// p99a.dat, other examples are p99b.dat and p99d.dat. There is also an example of a puzzle 
/// (p99c.dat) which does not have a solution.
/// 
/// Words are strings (character lists) of at least two characters. A horizontal or vertical 
/// sequence of character places in the crossword puzzle framework is called a site. Our 
/// problem is to find a compatible way of placing words onto sites.
/// 
/// Hints: (1) The problem is not easy. You will need some time to thoroughly understand it. 
/// So, don't give up too early! And remember that the objective is a clean solution, not 
/// just a quick-and-dirty hack!
/// 
/// (2) Reading the data file is a tricky problem for which a solution is provided in the 
/// file p99-readfile.pl. See the predicate read_lines/2.
/// 
/// (3) For efficiency reasons it is important, at least for larger puzzles, to sort the 
/// words and the sites in a particular order. For this part of the problem, the solution 
/// of P28 may be very helpful.
/// 
/// Example in F#:
/// 
/// ALPHA
/// ARES
/// POPPY
/// 
///   .
///   .
/// .....
///   . .
///   . .
///     .
/// > solve $ readCrossword "ALPHA\nARES\nPOPPY\n\n  .  \n  .  \n.....\n  . .\n  . .\n    .\n"
///  
/// [[((3,1),'A');((3,2),'L');((3,3),'P');((3,4),'H');((3,5),'A');((1,3),'P');((2,3)
/// ,'O');((3,3),'P');((4,3),'P');((5,3),'Y');((3,5),'A');((4,5),'R');((5,5),'E');((
/// 6,5),'S')]]
