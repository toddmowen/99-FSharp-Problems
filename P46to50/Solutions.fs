// [snippet: Ninety-Nine F# Problems - Problems 46 - 50 - Logic and Codes]
/// These are F# solutions of Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems 
/// (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems), 
/// which are themselves translations of Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems
/// (http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)
/// and Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems
/// (https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems).
///
/// If you would like to contribute a solution or fix any bugs, send 
/// an email to paks at kitiara dot org with the subject "99 F# problems". 
/// I'll try to update the problem as soon as possible.
///
/// The problems have different levels of difficulty. Those marked with a single asterisk (*) 
/// are easy. If you have successfully solved the preceeding problems you should be able to 
/// solve them within a few (say 15) minutes. Problems marked with two asterisks (**) are of 
/// intermediate difficulty. If you are a skilled F# programmer it shouldn't take you more than 
/// 30-90 minutes to solve them. Problems marked with three asterisks (***) are more difficult. 
/// You may need more time (i.e. a few hours or more) to find a good solution
///
/// Though the problems number from 1 to 99, there are some gaps and some additions marked with 
/// letters. There are actually only 88 problems.

// [snippet: (**) Problem 46 : Define Logical predicates]
/// Define predicates and/2, or/2, nand/2, nor/2, xor/2, impl/2 and equ/2 (for logical 
/// equivalence) which succeed or fail according to the result of their respective 
/// operations; e.g. and(A,B) will succeed, if and only if both A and B succeed.
///  
/// A logical expression in two variables can then be written as in the following example: 
/// and(or(A,B),nand(A,B)).
///  
/// Now, write a predicate table/3 which prints the truth table of a given logical 
/// expression in two variables.
///  
/// Example: 
/// (table A B (and A (or A B)))
/// true true true
/// true fail true
/// fail true fail
/// fail fail fail
///  
/// Example in F#: 
/// 
/// > table (fun a b -> (and' a (or' a b)));;
/// true true true
/// true false true
/// false true false
/// false false false
/// val it : unit = ()

// [/snippet]

// [snippet: (*) Problem 47 : Truth tables for logical expressions (2).]
/// Continue problem P46 by defining and/2, or/2, etc as being operators. This allows to write 
/// the logical expression in the more natural way, as in the example: A and (A or not B). 
/// Define operator precedence as usual; i.e. as in Java.
///  
/// Example: 
/// * (table A B (A and (A or not B)))
/// true true true
/// true fail true
/// fail true fail
/// fail fail fail
///  
/// Example in F#: 
/// 
/// > table2 (fun a b -> a && (a || not b));;
/// true true true
/// true false true
/// false true false
/// false false false
/// val it : unit = ()

// [/snippet]

// [snippet: (**) Problem 48 : Truth tables for logical expressions (3).]
/// Generalize problem P47 in such a way that the logical expression may contain any 
/// number of logical variables. Define table/2 in a way that table(List,Expr) prints the 
/// truth table for the expression Expr, which contains the logical variables enumerated 
/// in List.
///  
/// Example: 
/// * (table (A,B,C) (A and (B or C) equ A and B or A and C))
/// true true true true
/// true true fail true
/// true fail true true
/// true fail fail true
/// fail true true true
/// fail true fail true
/// fail fail true true
/// fail fail fail true
///  
/// Example in F#: 
/// 
/// > tablen 3 (fun [a;b;c] -> a && (b || c) = a && b || a && c)
/// warning FS0025: Incomplete pattern matches on this expression. ...
/// True True True true
/// False True True false
/// True False True true
/// False False True false
/// True True False true
/// False True False false
/// True False False false
/// False False False false
/// val it : unit = ()

// [snippet: (**) Problem 49 : Gray codes.]
/// An n-bit Gray code is a sequence of n-bit strings constructed according to certain rules.
/// For example,
///
/// n = 1: C(1) = ['0','1'].
/// n = 2: C(2) = ['00','01','11','10'].
/// n = 3: C(3) = ['000','001','011','010',´110´,´111´,´101´,´100´].
///  
/// Find out the construction rules and write a predicate with the following specification:
///  % gray(N,C) :- C is the N-bit Gray code
///  
/// Can you apply the method of "result caching" in order to make the predicate more efficient, 
/// when it is to be used repeatedly?
///  
/// Example in F#: 
/// 
/// P49> gray 3
/// ["000","001","011","010","110","111","101","100"]

// [/snippet]
   
// [snippet: (***) Problem 50 : Huffman codes.]
/// We suppose a set of symbols with their frequencies, given as a list of fr(S,F) terms. 
/// Example: [fr(a,45),fr(b,13),fr(c,12),fr(d,16),fr(e,9),fr(f,5)]. Our objective is to 
/// construct /// a list hc(S,C) terms, where C is the Huffman code word for the symbol 
/// S. In our example, the result could be Hs = [hc(a,'0'), hc(b,'101'), hc(c,'100'), 
/// hc(d,'111'), hc(e,'1101'), hc(f,'1100')] [hc(a,'01'),...etc.]. The task shall be 
/// performed by the predicate huffman/2 defined as follows:
/// 
///  % huffman(Fs,Hs) :- Hs is the Huffman code table for the frequency table Fs
///  
/// Example in F#: 
/// 
/// > huffman [('a',45);('b',13);('c',12);('d',16);('e',9);('f',5)];;
/// val it : (char * string) list =
///   [('a', "0"); ('b', "101"); ('c', "100"); ('d', "111"); ('e', "1101");
///    ('f', "1100")]
